Lucy,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Phillip

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

 Did you add some more security to the expost hourly summary?  It keeps

Heather,

This is exactly what we need.  Would it possible to add the prior day for each of the dates below to the pivot table.  In order to validate the curve shift on the dates below we also need the prior days ending positions.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen

HOPE AHEAD: WHAT I LEARNED FROM 2001'S TRAGEDIES

    As years go, 2001 sucked. But adversity teaches
         us more important lessons than prosperity.
         So my bet is that 2001 and the upcoming 2002
         will prove to be very educational--and in
         ways that matter. Here's what I learned this
         year, as I saw technology--and the world--change
         for good.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

2002 IN REVIEW: NOT PERFECT, BUT IT SURE BEAT 2001

    Welcome to my 2002 Year in Review column, which
         I feel very safe in asserting you are reading
         here first. It's been a pretty good year, unless
         of course you hate Microsoft, love Linux,
         or were hoping HP and Compaq would unite. Read
         on for my highlights of the year that's about
         to happen.

    MS STALLING?... MORE JOBS IN 2002... CABLE WOES PERSIST...

    Could Microsoft be stalling? The nine
    states still pursing the software giant's
    antitrust case sure think so. They've
    asked a federal judge to reject Microsoft's
    request to delay the remedy hearings,
    though Microsoft says any holdup is
    the states' fault for seeking such a
    tough remedy.

Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same
level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You
say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I
just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost
was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we
can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90
per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the
true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with
SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can
decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints
completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with
8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that
is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of
$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within
that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built
house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a
radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same
energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to
a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional
costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help
me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from
Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

Phillip,
 
Could you please do me a favor?  I would like  to read your current title policy to see what it says about easements.  You  should have received a copy during your closing.  I don't know how many  pages it will be but let me know how you want to handle getting a copy  made.  I'll be happy to make the copy, or whatever makes it easy for  you.

Phillip & Keith

Attached is the first draw request, I will need some of these funds immediately. I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.

Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).

I have a funeral at 10:00 and I will be back about 1:00. I look forward to hearing from you.

My interpretation of this is that we made $1.2Bn total, half from new deals and the other half from reserve releases, and when you back out the prudency release you get back to zero net curve shift for 2001, which is what the original file had (approximately)

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Product Side
+	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week
				Phase 2 - First Month
				Phase 3 - First Quarter

Target Number of Transactions

Phillip,

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.""  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen",CAS

Your Internet Banking accounts are now setup again for accessing. The
login id is still your main acct. # with the password being reset to the
last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the
primary account holder).  You will then be directed to a screen that
asks for information such as:
Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire.  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive. One major change is the
wording of your accounts names (they have changed to product types and
not descriptions). You can change your account descriptions by clicking
on the Nicknames button and entering your own account description.

We are still working on getting the information to post again correctly
(your old account information has been removed, and we hope to have this
information converted shortly and back on-line), so you will notice that
credits and debits do not show up in the appropriate columns.
Transaction descriptions are correct and the balances information is
correct as of our last day of processing (11/16/01).

We appreciate your patience and continued support. Our goal is to be
fully operational and all information corrected before the holiday
season.

Please make sure to record any suggestions (or problems) that you might
have concerning our web site.  Again, thanks for banking with State Bank
& Trust and happy surfing.

To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there:

We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest
apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to
your questions. The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3)
possibilities:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message that you have
exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message ""You
have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again
tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password
reset."" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one
quickly with you online (on the phone). Should you receive this message,
please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard
Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @
830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please
leave your Name, Account # and call back #.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder.

3)  If you see this error message ""Invalid login; please try again""
(after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last
category. Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly
(we will not release any information about these accounts until we
verify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing
these accounts today and should have them available for access this
afternoon (late) or this evening. Once we release these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Should you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and
transactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night). We
will have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then
information will be as of Monday (11/19/01). Again we want to thank you
for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to
continuing to service your IBS needs in the future.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon

Good Morning! I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family and safe travels.

As per our meeting on Tuesday, please identify people you think will be good for the expert story roles. You can provide me a list and either contact them first or provide me with an introduction to get their commitment. Thanks a million in advance for your continued support of this project.

Cheers

Subject:	SMEs for expert stories


Hello Kirk --

Hope you are doing well!

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of
producint the expert stories for our simulation.  I understand you will be
obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank you
for your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:

Number of SMEs needed:  10
Number of expert stories: 20-25
Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a
mix of structurers, originators and traders


I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will
follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The main
difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of
11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with
them for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at
least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.

(11/26-11/28)
                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs
(11/28-11/30)
                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding
the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to
discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.
(12/3-12/6)
               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we
need and where they can provide stories.
                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the
stories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video
shoot.
                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.
                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to
SMEs
(12/10-12/12)
                          --Video shoot

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ann

Michelle
Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).

Sheri

When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

Kirk -

I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) for
you to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated in
the scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company as
both Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so that
there is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coach
exit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In reference
to your concern over ""locking in a price"" as collusion, those were
Phillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

FYI

Sheri
The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls & meetings. Also cc me on their emails or forward to me  their  emails. This will keep me in the loop. Thanks

Phillip
If you have some additional people in mind, we need them identified as soon as possible. Thanks

Kirk -

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from Enron Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the
storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and
enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Have a good day!

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve

Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

Could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for Bishops Corner.  I
was working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it I should
just have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals.

Also, I need the vendor payee list that you created for the Land and Soft
costs. I need to re-format it by draw number and to the Bank One format, and
again it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it.

Please take a look at the following summary and compare to your numbers to
see if you agree.

I think you thought you had more to fund. However, I do not see that you
accounted for the cash portion of the Developer fee that you paid CIS.  Am I
looking at this right? Please let me know and attach? the files discussed
above.  I am working all day Monday so I hope I can get it before then if
possible.

Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.

I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.

In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you. With best regards, Jim Wills

Subject:=09FW:=20


Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen   =20

Phillip,

Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you
gave us and move forward with this approach.

2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics
reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
sign-off on each topic.

3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will
meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
Monday with the room number.)

Have a good weekend.
Mery

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

Phillip,

I will get a room for our Wednesday 10:00 meeting and e-mail you with the
room number. FYI, our goal is to discuss the expert path (best answers) for
the storage problem and to ask you some specific questions regarding
storage.

Also, if you have time, could you send me a definition of Intra-Month Risk?

Thank you for your help.
Mery

To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you
online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you
receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for
either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @
830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail
(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back
#.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)
ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon
Network Manager

Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up.""
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much
more realistic prices.""
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.
     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one
southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the
north.""
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices,
declined to $60 and less.""
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility
trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a
Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the ""socalprices"" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $?  If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where 
did they come from?  I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter.  We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.  It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.

Thanks.

--  WHAT'S NEW ON Y-LIFE  --
Jon Katz's Internet Domain
Will the Net change everything? Might we be overrun by new gadgets
and new technology? Will our lives be ruled by the almighty dot-
com? Will the Net fail? Don't believe the hype: Katz has a simple
guide to surviving the panic.
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70392:8593142

--  NET RADIO SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Lost in the cosmos of Net-radio stations? Sorry, this site
will probably only add to the confusion. FMcities houses over 1,350
stations in North America, organized by city. Sound daunting? It
is... but here's the good part - every site listed here is 100-
percent commercial-free. That's right, nothing but the good stuff.
Sorry, Pepsi. Sorry, McDonald's. Sorry, RJ Reynolds...
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70393:8593142

--  INCREDIBLY USEFUL SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: ""Always buy a Swiss watch, an American motorcycle, and a
Japanese radio."" If that's the kind of buying advice the folks at
the water cooler are giving you, it's time to look elsewhere - like
ConsumerSearch. Whether what you want is as complicated as a car or
computer or as simple as a kitchen knife, you'll find links to
reviews here, distilled so that you can quickly scan for the best
items in each category.
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70394:8593142

--  PRETTY STRANGE SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Are you a loser? Do you have lots of time on your hands
because no one would socialize with you if your life depended on
it? Do you have incredible powers of concentration for even the
most mundane and boring tasks? Congratulations! You might be the
person with the strength, stamina, and general dorkiness to win the
World Mouseclicking Competition.

Today: A reader writes, ""Can I update all my Netscape Bookmarks at
the same time? With nearly 500 of them, I don't have time to check
each one individually."" Whoa there, Mr. Busy Bee, you don't *have*
to check those bookmarks individually, says the Guru. You can check
them all at once, and you don't even have to download any confusing
programs to do it.
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70398:8593142

--  FORWARD/JOKE OF THE DAY  --
Today: It's a surprisingly long list of ""I used to be a ____

barber, but I just couldn't cut it."" Can you guess what wacky twist
a math teacher would put on that statement? A gardener? A musician?
A person who makes mufflers? There's only one way to find out...

Any merit to mentioning that there has been an initial ""supply"" response in 
terms of pipeline infrastructure - open seasons/expansion efforts on behalf 
of Kern River, Transwestern and PGT (not yet announced)?

Recognizing the time constraints you face, I've tried to 1) clear up a few 
inaccuracies and 2) massage some of the sharper language without taking a 
chainsaw to the otherwise good job.

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.  The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

Don Badley

Phillip--To the extent that we can give Chair Hoecker our spin on the reasons 
for the hikes, we would like to.  The Commission is getting calls from 
legislators, DOE, etc. about the prices and is going to have to provide some 
response.  Better if it coincides with Enron's view and is not anti-market.  
We still haven't decided what we will provide.  You definitely will be 
included in that discussion once we get the numbers from accounting.  Thanks.

Christy,

 I read these points and they definitely need some touch up.  I don't 
understand why we need to give our commentary on  why prices are so high in 
California.  This subject has already gotten so much press.

Leslie,after seeing point # 3 in writing , I would be extremely reluctant to 
submit. This kind of conjecture about  market manipulation , coming from us. 
would only serve to fuel the fires of the naysayers- I would delete. Thanks.

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

Due to some problems with my email yesterday, I may not have received your 
RSVP.....please excuse any confusion this may have caused.


RSVP REQUESTED!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an ""Emissions Strategy 
Meeting"" on Friday, May 18 to discuss global emissions issues -- such as air 
quality regulation, climate change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and 
explore some of the potential business opportunities for Enron commercial 
groups.

WHEN:  Friday, May 18
TIME:   10:00 am - 3:00 pm - lunch will be provided
WHERE:  Enron Building, 8C1 (8th floor)

A video conference is being organized to enable broad participation from the 
London office and a teleconference will be set up for others who would like

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Karen,

Can you tell me when Matt Smith and Jason Wolfe are scheduled to move to new rotations?  Also what are their next assignments.  I would like to move Matt Smith into an assistant trading rotation and have Jason move in to Matt's current rotation in the fundamentals group.

Greg,

I typed up this resume from scratch in 10 minutes.  Will it do?  If you work for the same company for 8 years your resume tends to get dusty.
Let me know if I need to beef it up or if I need to include any financial information.

I wanted you to review it before I sent it to Montez.  If it is ok please forward to Montez.

Jeff,

I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.

In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.

I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.

I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

Phillip

I spoke with Pauline and she says she is ready to transfer the utilities.
However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownership
interests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes.
(per her attorneys advice).  She is ready to sign the settlement, but she
has not been able to talk to her lawyer who is tied up in court.

I have attached a Word file with the a letter to them which authorizes the
transfer.  If it is acceptable please sign and fax to her directly at
830-372-5400.  Please fax to me also.

Thanks.

Faith,

Two changes need to be made to the list.  First, Jason Wolfe is a trading track analyst on the west desk.  Second,  Matt Lenhart should be an Associate as his duties and responsibilities are identical to Monique S, Jay R., and Randy G.  I don't know if this change can be made administatively or if I need to bring this up during PRC.  Please let me know.

Jeff,

Here is a short letter that indicates I will give consent contingent to the items we discussed.  I didn't make any reference to why I took the utilities out of my name.
I left that for you to explain to her that we need to have a cutoff date so we can calculate the final amount.  I hope you can make her understand that I have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time.  Since my attorney is out of town until Monday and I doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership (certainly not the 1st lienholders consent) we will have to work together next week.  

If you want to modify this letter let me know.  I am also faxing you a sign copy.

We talked to Bob Braden about designing the foundations using the geottech
information that we was done previously so as not to delay the permitting
process. He said that he would do a preliminary design for permitting only
and as soon as he gets the new geotech information showing the actual
borings where the buildings are actually going to go, he will revise his
foundation designs. He is in the process of sending us a revised proposal
showing the additional costs to do this extra designing. Any questions,
please call me. Thanks.

Carlos,

Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  

Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  

I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:

Sales price:		2,100,000
Purchase price		1,200,000
Fees&Devel costs	  500,000

Profit			 400,000

The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.

I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.

I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. 

 First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?

Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.

If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Jeff,

I understand you spoke to Jacques Craig about the consent and assignment documents.  Maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have.  

I spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out today.  So I should have an amount on Wednesday.  I will email and fax the amount and the supporting bills as soon as possible.  Maybe we can close out the release this week and consent to the assignment pending 1st lien holder approval.

I have a favor to ask you.  I received the check from Pauline that was due May 20th.  However, I have misplaced it.  Can you ask her to put a stop on her 1st check and send me another (net of any costs for the stop payment).   If you would prefer for me to call her myself, I will.  It seems that communicating through you is working well. 

Thanks for all your help.

There are two additional items involving the sale that she is requesting.

1.  She wants to transfer the pay phone account
2.  She wants reimbursement for the bills that I am faxing to you.

I will talk to her again about the check that she sent.

We need to work on getting the pay phone transfer, and the small outstanding

John,

Two items:

1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40
	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.
	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.


 
2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues.

Subject:	El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)

I have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.  Let me know if you want a copy faxed.",Cash

jeff,

Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

Subject:	Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential
Sensitivity:	Confidential

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff",CAS

This note is to give you my feedback on Jeanie Slone.  

She has been extremely helpful with all personnel issues during the last six months.  Without exception she has satisfied any request I have made of her.  She has done an excellent job dealing with performance reviews (both good and bad), salary, and title issues.

jacques,

I have attached a summary of the utilities I paid since the 4/20 closing.  The total is $7,328.87.  Do you need to incorporate this number is the release  or can I just net this amount against the $11,000 and pay them the difference.  Do they have an executable copy of the release?  I would like to settle up on the repairs, utilities, and the release now.  I don't want these issues to get bogged down with the 1st lienholders approval of any assignments.

Per last week's call, I am circulating updated FERC staff talking points to the entire Western Wholesale group.  This version of the talking points incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.

Phillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are being currently litigated by the FERC.

Jim, 

Following up on the message I left you, I thought I'd send you some of the basic information on the Crossroads project to see if you have any interest in that area:

The facility will be a high flexibility, bedded salt cavern
Initial startup is expected in summer 2002 with 2 bcf working gas, eventual rampup to 3 bcf 
75 MMCF/D injection (at 2 bcf working)
200 MMCF/D withdrawal (at 2 bcf working)
Located near Brush, Colorado, in Morgan County.
Located at far east end of PSCo system, 7 miles from CIG and 10 miles from Kinder Morgan

This is all the information I have at the moment, in addition to some maps which you are welcomed to look at.  Garry Wilson and I will be meeting with the developer in Denver on Monday, but he'd like to see if we have interest sooner than that.  I apologize for the last-minute nature of the request, but we were just hoping for an initial gauge of your interest.  

Do you have any use for this capacity?  If so, at what price?  What would your timing requirements be?  Would you have any other conditions that would increase interest in this capacity?

Thanks for your attention.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions, I'll try following up with you tomorrow if you ahve any free time.  Thanks!

Jacques,

Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb.  This letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo's and Success Real Estate.  Don't they need something signed from Southern Pacific Bank?

I certainly don't plan on signing any assignment documents before the release is signed and settled.  Has their attorney contacted you with any revisions?  Is the ball in their court?

Greg,

I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  =
First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, p=
art of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for ""seniors"".  I would l=
ike to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assist=
ed living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I hav=
e mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over th=
e next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity r=
equirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest p=
artner like Keith.

Here is the article:

Sector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  H=
ome and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised futu=
re land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos Ci=
ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two =
Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa=
re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a=
nd appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affe=
cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne=
r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  We=
atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari=
ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say=
s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two =
plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir=
ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid=
ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of=
 commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a=
dditional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight a=
cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su=
ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing=
 development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of co=
mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to ""community commerci=
al"" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens=
ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit=
h buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t=
o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. =
 However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som=
e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po=
se on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th=
e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave=
nue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the=
 plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron=
 Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between=
 the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughso=
n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect=
or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th=
e area as development proceeds.  ""I'd rather say ""no' and if someone comes =
us with a really good idea, look at it then,"" Hughson said.  Councilman Ed =
Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th=
e curb cut.  ""It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe=
n there,"" Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud=
e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San =
Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting =
against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the=
 meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa=
l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good =
compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit=
ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin=
g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests =
of the city as a whole.  ""This is not a victory for one side or the other,""=
 said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to=
 Weatherford's initial plans for his property, ""but a victory for the City =
of San Marcos. We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way."" =09

I spoke with their attorney this AM, and he said that he is reviewing the
settlement document and will like to get everything settled before he leaves
on vacation. (even though he has had the document for a month?)

I suggested that he talk to Jacques to speed the process up.  Pauline may
have been slowing the process by not giving him info.

You should probably have Jacques speak with their attorney (Kolb) if he does
not make contact by tomorrow.

Also, Pauline wants to know if you have any info. on a contact name for the
pay phone.

Call me if you need anything.

Kay,

I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important.

On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.  Heather is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot Kelsey.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her.

Pat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.
We should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.  See you soon.

Keith

Jacques,

Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.

Phillip

Phillip, 
      I received a fax of the consent agreement the attorney on the Stage

I called and left a message that I had comments on that agreement and that we

the utility issue resolved at one time. I have jury duty Monday and will call

Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Corporation

El Paso Announces Binding Open Season for Additional Capacity on Line 2000

HOUSTON, July 10 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Natural Gas Company, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news), announced today a binding open season for 320 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of pipeline capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.

The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.

The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.

``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.

Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.

El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

Jay,

I need to compile a report that shows transaction volume by basis location(Basis Swaps) and volume by location for Phys Forwards as well as Finc Swaps for Power.

We have given them a list of the locations at which we like to make markets.  They want to see historical volumes at those location to judge the liquidity at each location.  

You can reach me at 713-515-3949 or x37041. 

Thanks for your help.

Hunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,
We have been meeting with the Ocean Energy, Inc. (""OEI"") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. 
For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. 
Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. 
OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. 
The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. 
This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.
The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784.

Michael,

I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.  Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.  The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.  

It was worth a try.

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

Here is the following letter.  I put the amount that we are currently spending on food per month.  As of right now, we are having to borrow different peoples credit cards for lunches.  A lot of restaurants do not open accounts on credit.  They only take payment at time of order.

My message was confusing.  I needed one more id that has access to all products.  It is for the use of someone on the West Desk.  I do not need an ID that can only trade the West region.  If possible, please modify simtrader7.

Hi Phillip,

simtrader7 has access to all US gas (physical and financial) and all West power.  Gas access is not regionalized, so I can't give the account access to just West gas.  Let me know if this isn't what you want.

Jay,

My message was confusing.  I needed one more id that has access to all products.  It is for the use of someone on the West Desk.  I do not need an ID that can only trade the West region.  If possible, please modify simtrader7.

Thank you,
Phillip

Hi Phillip,

simtrader7 has access to all US gas (physical and financial) and all West power.  Gas access is not regionalized, so I can't give the account access to just West gas.  Let me know if this isn't what you want.

Thanks!

In each case, the password is the same as the username.

Let me know if you have any questions.

On Friday, July 13th, a shipper group filed a complaint against El Paso Nat=
ural Gas alleging that the pipeline has oversold capacity into California d=
ue in part to unlimited growth of demands by full requirements customers.  =
The complainants request:

(1) that all full requirements customers be converted to contract demand cu=
stomers at reasonable levels;

(2) a mandatory expansion of the pipeline system to be used to meet El Paso=
's existing firm transportation obligations; and

(3) that FERC prohibit El Paso from collecting demand charges for firm serv=
ice it is unable to provide until such time as El Paso can show that it is =
capable of meeting its firm service obligations.

A Technical Conference in El Paso's Order No. 637 proceeding (RP00-336) is =
scheduled for Wed., July 18, 2001 to discuss El Paso's systemwide capacity =
allocation issues, which will include topics addressed in the complaint.=20

Jacques, 

Here is the payoff info for the unsecured note:

Assuming the note is paid before the 7/20 payment is due:  $36,523 + $7/day accrued interest since 6/20.  For example, if paid on 7/18 the balance would be $36,719.

If the Kuo's make the payment due on 7/20, then the payoff amount would be $36,304 + $7/day accrued interest after 7/20.

The amortization schedule is attached.

Greg,

I have been working with Bill Montez.  I furnished a personal financial statement, EIN number, and we worked through a variety of forms.  I am pulling together the partnership agreement and other organizational documents.  Let me know what else I need to do.

I received the final geotech report yesterday.  Let me know what this means.  It did not look good to me.  Crazy amounts of fill and still nowhere near a PVR of 1"".  

Bobincheck got me all fired up about HUD being out of money yesterday.  Darrell calmed me down somewhat, but should we go ahead and submit a package to Bank One just in case?

Still need to look at the numbers once again.  Email when ready.

Talk to you soon.

Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies ""to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports."" Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). ( BS)",Cash

Heather,

This is exactly what we need.  Would it possible to add the prior day for each of the dates below to the pivot table.  In order to validate the curve shift on the dates below we also need the prior days ending positions.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen

Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and approves it to come back online, there is no formal process to grant El Paso permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d. Therefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days. The uncertainty still lies in the time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its review.",CAS

Jacques,

Keith and I were able to resolve our concerns about having the GP as a  corporation.  Several CPA's assured us that the tax treatment fears we had were not a significant risk.  Therefore,  we are ready to finalize the agreements.  What is the next step?  Do we just execute the copies we have?

I haven't heard anything else on the stagecoach from Kevin Kolb.  I keep leaving messages.

Mike,

Here is my first pass at midyear reviews.  

        

Let me know if you want me to draft something for Monique.  I will make sure that Matt Smith and Jason Wolfe are reviewed appropriately.  That just leaves Susan.

cost is $19,000, which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  the investment prior to, obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement, provided it was for direct costs.  thus, the additional equity for the, improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   even if the maximum loan would, high as $25,000.  this would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000, cover
